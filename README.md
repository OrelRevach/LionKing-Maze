We implemented in Java (8) a maze game, while the GUI was written with XML in JavaFX. This task encompassed many advanced programming principles such as proper class and interface design, server/client, proper use of thread pools, binding and SOLID coding guidelines. It also involved several design patterns such as decorator, observer/observable and singleton to name a few. We also practice use with Maven repositories manager include log4j2 LogManager
